#### General info
The following Computer-Graphics-Project (Rotating Fan) is implemented with an OpenGL API in C/C++, 
and are tested for Windows operating System. OpenGL stands for Open source Graphics 
Libraries which includes the GL, GLU & GLUT library. Notice that, API,GL, GLU and GLUT 
indicates the Application Programming Interface, core Graphics Library, Graphics Library 
Utility and Graphics Library Utility Toolkit, respectively.

Please let me know, if you have any comments and suggestion.

#### Abstruction
In this mini-project we have demonstrated the Rotation of Fan by using OpenGL and the model is designed with pure C++ code. OpenGL is a freely available Computer Graphics operating system. Here we use header files of, OpenGL is an interactive environment. When the program is executed the fan would be rotating at its normal speed and also a mouse click event is added which leads to two options. The first option is for modifying the speed and the second is for quitting. The first option further has two more options i.e., fast and slow. On selecting a fast option the rotation speed of the fan will increase and on selecting a slow option the rotation speed of the fan will decrease.


#### User Requirements
Easy to understand and should be simple.
The built-in functions should be utilized to the maximum extent.
OpenGL library facilities should be used.


#### Hardware Requirements
Intel Pentium CPU 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 (K8) 2.6 GHz or higher
1 GB RAM or more
Mouse
Keyboard 108 standard
Monitor resolution 800×600



#### Software Requirements:
Programming Language: C / C++ Using OpenGL
Operating System: Windows / Linux
Compiler: C / C++ Compiler (GCC)
IDE: Code Blocks
Functional Requirements: GLUT

#### Scope
The user can modify the speed of the fan either by increasing its speed or by decreasing the speed. It is user-friendly and intuitive to users. It supports user interaction through the keyboard. This project has been implemented efficiently to obtain the optimized results and also various functions and features that are made available by the OpenGL software package have been utilized effectively.

#### Features
When we press the ‘s’ button, the fan starts spinning with its blades.

If we press  the ‘s’ button again the fan will stops.


If we press and hold the ‘k’ button for a few seconds fans speed will increases. And if we release the ‘k’ button  fans speed will be normal again. 


If we press the 'i' button the speed of fan will decreases.



This three features is the main functions of this project.
